# base64_encode_decode
Program for base encoding and decoding using C language.

Code encodes text or binary input to base64 codes and decodes input consisting of base64 codes or base64 codes inside MIME messages into original text or binary form. If decoded input is not pure base64 code, it will not be coded. In MIME messages only base64 sections will be decoded.

Program will be run on command line.
